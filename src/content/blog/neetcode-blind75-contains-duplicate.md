I’ve decided that it's time to get serious about *Data Structures and
Algorithms*, which is why I've started to tackle the [NeetCode
Blind75](https://neetcode.io/practice). It’s a curated list of 75 essential
coding interview problems, broken down by topic, and widely regarded as one of
the best ways to prepare for real-world interviews or just level up your
algorithmic thinking.

I will be doing the problems initially in Python, although I might go back and
do them again in another language and/or paradigm. C would be fun at a later
stage, especially if I wanted to kick things up a gear!

## Methodology

I didn't want to do the problems on Neet- or Leetcode. I wanted the code on my
own machine with my own tests.

The way I'm going to do this is to check out the Neetcode problem, and then have
ChatGPT write some tests for me, which I'll expand. Then, I can solve the
problem in as many different ways as I want.

## Intro to Problem #1: Contains Duplicates

The first problem is deceptively simple:

*Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least
twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.*

Seems straightforward, but as is often the case, there are multiple ways to
solve it, each with different tradeoffs. I wanted to explore that explicitly, so
I wrote three different approaches: a brute-force solution, a hash map-based
solution, and a sort-based solution.

---

### Brute-force solution

```python
def brute_force(arr: list[int]) -> bool:
    result = False
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if result == True:
            break
        for j in range(len(arr)):
            if j == i:
                continue
            if arr[i] == arr[j]:
                result = True
                break
    return result
```

This checks every pair. Because there are two nested loops, it's **O(n²)** in
time complexity — inefficient but good for establishing baseline logic. 

### Hash map solution

```python
def hashmap(arr: list[int]) -> bool:
    hash = dict()
    for item in arr:
        if item in hash:
            return True
        hash[item] = True
    return False
```

This is much more efficient: **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space. We're leveraging
a dictionary to track what we've seen. Here is our first tradeoff: We can
sacrifice some memory to save some (a lot of) time.

### Sort and compare solution

```python
def sort_pairs(arr: list[int]) -> bool:
    arr = sorted(arr)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == arr[i-1]:
            return True
    return False
```

Sorting takes **O(n log n)**, but once sorted, it’s fast and clean to compare adjacent elements.

## Final Thoughts

I’m aiming to document each of the Blind75 problems as I go — not just the
solutions, but also my reasoning and takeaways. This is as much about
reinforcing my own understanding as it is about building a public record of
progress.
